## Overview

This is a little POC that I've started in order to know more about REACT and its components, inherance, properties, models, view, etc. What I want to achieve in this sample is having best practices, the way to do differents things in order to review this if I forgot something when I'm writting code in REACT.

## About the app

This app save your list of friends with the option to add them into a new list, the favorite friend's list. The intention here is create more functionalities to have a better app and maybe the idea can change in the proccess of developing. Feel free to fork this project and add features.

## Pre Requisites

You need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and use your favorite IDE to edit the code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.


## Posible enhancements

The component <FriendsListFavorites> can be deleted and it would be better to use only one component. For this purpose the <FriendsList> component can be modified.
